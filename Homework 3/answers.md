4 strategies that can be used to minimize the observed error of the multi-layer perceptron regressor are:
 - increase the training sample;

 - early stopping: prevent overfitting by stopping the training when the testing error rate starts increasing;

 - change the complexity of the network structure and parameters by adding/removing nodes and ensuring the weights keep small, since this indicate a less complex model and therefore more stable and less prone to error from outliers in the input

 - regularization:
 - noise:
