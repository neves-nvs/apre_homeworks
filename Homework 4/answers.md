a) Based on the external measure of each solution we conclude that in the solution with k=2 the clusters overall resemble less of their class than in the k=3 solution, meaning, each cluster in the k=3 solution is more adapted to a specific class.

b) Based on the silhouette values of each solutions, we conclude that in the solution with k=2 the cluster are overall further apart from each other than in the k=3 solution.

Analising the graph obtained in the previous question based on the two top features we can see that: in terms of classification, they classify reasonably well the data as benign/malignant; in terms of clustering, they don't describe a very good solution, with two of the cluster basically mescled together, working almost as a single cluster and the last one, even if clear, slightly overlapping the other group. Indicating that probably a better k (number of cluster would be k=2).
